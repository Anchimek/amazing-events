In this project I used HTML, CSS, JS without framework. 
I applied:
-semantic tags in HTML for cuter code and better positioning, 
-preprocessor SASS, 
-animations, 
-media queries,
-keyframes,
-gsap,
-Intersection Observer API,
-and much much more.

I used also images from freepik.com, fonts from fonts.google.com and icons from fontello.com.
